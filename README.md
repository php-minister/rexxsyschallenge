This is code challenge task

Scenario: Imagine an external event booking system exports a simple plain json export file (you find the file atteched to this email) of the newest bookings. This data should be presented in our system.

What you need to do?

Design a database scheme for optimized storage
Read the json data and save it to the database using php
Create a simple page with filters for the employee name, event name and date
Output the filtered results in a table below the filters
Add a last row for the total price of all filtered entries
Additional information: The external system changed the timezone of the event date. Prior to version 1.0.17+60 it was Europe/Berlin. Afterwards it is UTC. Please provide a tested class for the version comparison.
